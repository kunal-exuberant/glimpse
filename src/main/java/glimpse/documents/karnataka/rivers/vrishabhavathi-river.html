The majority of the sewage emanating from Bangalore is carried by these two rivers. <p>About Bangalore: is the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka. Located on the Deccan Plateau in the south-eastern part of Karnataka, Bangalore is India's third most populous city[2] and fifth-most populous urban agglomeration.</p> <p>Though historical references to the city predate 900 CE, a modern written history of continuous settlement exists only from 1537, when Kempe Gowda I, who many regard as the architect of modern Bangalore, built a mud-brick fort at the site and established it as a province of the imperial Vijayanagara Empire. During the British Raj, it became a centre of colonial rule in South India. The establishment of the Bangalore Cantonment brought in large numbers of migrants from other parts of the country.</p>

Bangalore receives rainfall from both the northeast and the southwest monsoons and the wettest months are September, October and August, in that order.[26] The summer heat is moderated by fairly frequent thunderstorms, which occasionally cause power outages and local flooding.

          <td>After centuries of the rule of the Western Gangas, Bengaluru was captured by the Cholas in 1024 CE which later passed on to the Chalukya-cholas in 1070. In 1116 the Hoysala Empire, overthrew the Cholas and extended its rule over Bangalore. Modern Bangalore was founded by a vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempe Gowda I, who built a mud-brick fort and a Nandi Temple in the proximity of modern Bangalore in 1537. Kempe Gowda referred to the new town as his "gandubhu-mi" or "Land of Heroes".[8] <p>Within Bangalore Fort, the town was divided into smaller divisions - each called a "pete" (IPA: [pe?te?]). The town had two main streets - Chikkapete Street, which ran east-west, and Doddapete Street, which ran north-south. Their intersection formed the Doddapete Square - the heart of Bangalore. Kempe Gowda's successor, Kempe Gowda II, built four famous towers that marked Bangalore's boundary.[13] During the Vijayanagara rule, Bangalore was also referred to as "Devara-yanagara" and "Kalya-napura" ("Auspicious City"). After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Bangalore's rule changed hands several times. In 1638, a large Bijapur army led by Ranadulla Khan and accompanied by Shahji Bhonsle defeated Kempe Gowda III and Bangalore was given to Shahji as a jagir. In 1687, the Mughal general Kasim Khan defeated Ekoji, son of Shahji, and then sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673-1704) of Mysore for 300,000 rupees.[14][15] After the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II in 1759, Hyder Ali, Commander-in-Chief of the Mysore Army, proclaimed himself the de facto ruler of Mysore. The kingdom later passed to Hyder Ali's son Tippu Sultan, known as the Tiger of Mysore. Bangalore was eventually incorporated into the British Indian Empire after Tippu Sultan was defeated and killed in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799). The British returned administrative control of the Bangalore "pe-te-" to the Maharaja of Mysore, choosing only to retain the Cantonment under their jurisdiction. The 'Residency' of Mysore State was first established at Mysore in 1799 and later shifted to Bangalore in the year 1804. It was abolished in the year 1843 only to be revived in 1881 at Bangalore and to be closed down permanently in 1947, with Indian independence. The British, found it easier to recruit employees in the Madras Presidency and relocate them to cantonment area during this period. The Kingdom of Mysore relocated its capital from Mysore city to Bangalore in 1831.[16] Two important developments during this period contributed to the rapid growth of the city: the introduction of telegraph connections and a rail connection to Madras in 1864.</p> </td>

Farmers suffer from skin allergies and cattle are infested with edema. Urban waste has contaminated well water and women tread almost two km for drinking water. <br>Result: Villages in and around Vrishbhavathi valley are highly polluted, taking a toll on people's health, cultivation and ecology. This was revealed in a study 'Economic and Environmental Implications of Groundwater Degradation in Vrishabhavathi River Basin' done by researchers at the University of Agricultural Sciences here.</p> <p>The Vrishabhavathi river, which originated in the south-western end of Bangalore, has dried up and now carries industrial effluents, urban sewage and improperly treated water from the BWSSB treatment plant. Three villages around the basin - Ittamadu, Ramanahalli and Gopahalli - were selected for the study. According to N. Nagaraj, who headed the research with H. Chandrashekar and K.P. Mangala, there has been a huge extent of land degradation in the area, with only 259 of the 318 acres of cultivable areas now available.</p> </td>
