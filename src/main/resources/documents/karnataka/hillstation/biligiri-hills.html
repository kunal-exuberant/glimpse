          <td>Biligiri Hills is a must for any person who wants to release his drudgery and stimulate his spirit by basking in the joy of natural glory. Located almost 120km from Mysore and 247kms from Bangalore, the picturesque Biligiri Hills are situated between the rivers Cauvery and Kapila. Biligiri signifies 'white capped', though the hills are hued in shimmering blue colours. Rising to a height of almost 5,091 ft above mean sea level, the hill extends from north to south for approximately sixteen kms. To the west, the lower hills are sheltered with wet deciduous forestry where elephants roam in abundance. <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The cheeping of the birds and the buzzing of the bees wake up the wildlife from their daily doze. A portion of Biligiri Hills is regarded sacred by Sholaga people. Sholaga people are the natives of Biligiri Hills. About five thousand Sholaga people reside in this area and practice hunting and shifting cultivation .In 1974 the region was declared as the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Wildlife Sanctuary. It encompasses a total area of approximately five hundred and forty kms above sea level. A simultaneous ban was imposed on shifting agriculture and hunting. In order that they were not completely estranged from their occupations, a small portion of land was allocated to them. Finally, they could carry on agricultural activities.</p>

           </div> <p>Another interesting getaway from Mysore for nature enthusiasts is the Biligiri Rangana Hills popularly known as the B.R.Hills. Though these hills are famous for the ancient temple on top of the hills, it is also home to a lesser-known wildlife sanctuary. The Biligiri Rangana Hills are 120kms from Mysore. The Billigiri Rangana hills are ideally located between the Cauvery and Kapila rivers. It is at a height of about 5, 091 feet above sea level and runs north to south for about 16kms. The lower hills are covered with rich deciduous forests that are home to a large number of elephants.</p> <p>The wildlife sanctuary covers an area of about 550sq.km. and is inhabited by a number of animals including elephants, sloth bears, bison, deer, porcupines and a number of other wild animals. It is said that the sanctuary has more than 250 species of birds like the Paradise Flycatcher, Racquet Trailed Drongo and the Crested Hawk Eagle, to name a few. The sanctuary is inhabited with such a large population of wildlife that one does not have to go looking for them. There is accommodation in the sanctuary in the form of Jungle lodges and resorts. The best time to get a good look at the wildlife is at dawn.</p> </td>

The forests form an important wildlife corridor between the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats, linking the largest populations of Asian Elephants and tigers in southern India. The most conspicuous mammals are the herds of wild elephants. The BR hills is the only forest east of the main Western ghats mountain ranges in the central southern peninsula to harbour these panchyderms in large numbers. The forests were the study area for R.

One of them houses the Vishnuvardhana Hoysaleshwara Linga and the other the Shanthaleshwara Linga.
